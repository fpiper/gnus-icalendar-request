* gnus-icalendar-request

Extension of gnus-icalendar to format icalendar event requests based on [[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5545][RFC 5545]].

** Functionality TODOs

- [ ] Rethink ways to capture event data :: Based on /message draft/ (basically as implemented so far), on /org headline/, on /org capture/, on â€¦?
- [ ] Improve start/end date capturing :: Other ways than org-timestamps? Also need to differentiate time ranges and whole day ranges.
- [ ] Support recurring events :: Requires some way of capturing the RRULE parameter.
- [ ] Update self participation type :: Default to ORGANIZER or NON-PARTICIPANT?
- [ ] Sequence handling :: Requires extension of the ~gnus-icalendar-event-request~ class with the sequence property and a smart way to determine the actual sequence number. Necessary for any event modifications (cancelling, updating, adding participants, changing time)
- [ ] Cancelling events :: Requires some sense of tracking of sent out events. Just let the user handle this with org mode or similar and provide functions to format the CANCEL message? 
- [ ] Sending out updates :: After an attendee accepts or declines the RFC
- [ ] Adding/Removing participants  ::
- [ ] Updating event time ::

** Code TODOs
- [X] Cleanup description creation
- [X] Check attendee capturing from email ~From~ header.
- [ ] Based on insertion method remove the multipart section or switch ~multipart/alternative~ if ~text/plain~ contains the same data as the ~text/calendar~ part.
- [X] +Split default attendee line format into a ~defvar~ in ~gnus-icalendar--format-attendee~.+
